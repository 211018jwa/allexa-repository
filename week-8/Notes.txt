Component Lifecycle
- angular application
  - navigate through different pages
  - pages: components needed at specific times but not always
  - components are easily created and destroyed
  - functions: lifecycle hooks
    - invoked under certain conditions during the component lifecycle
    - can be used to perform useful actions

- constructor: instantiates and populates the initial properties
  - typically through dependency injection in the case of angular
  - only called once
- ngOnChanges(): whenever the input properties of a component change
  - this method is called
  - can be called multiple times
- ngOnInit(): called one time when component is first initialized
  - called when component is already rendered to the DOM
- ngDoCheck(): called after ngOnChanges() and ngOnInit()
  - use for change detection
- ngOnDestroy(): called before Angular destroys the component
