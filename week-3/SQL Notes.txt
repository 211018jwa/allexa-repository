database normalization
- reduce redundancy when designing a database
-lvl of normalization
  - 0NF = total chaos
  - 1NF = datashould be atomic
    - must have a primary key
  - 2NF = 1NF + no partial dependencies
    - must describe the entire key
  - 3NF = 2NF + no transative dependencies
    - describes nothing but the key

Multiplicity / Cardinality
- 1 to 1
- 1 to many
- many to many
