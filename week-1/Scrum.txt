-agile is abstract
- scrum is concrete implementation of agile

https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html

-light weight framework
-3 high level ideas
  - Artifacts
  - Roles
  - Ceremonies

Sprint
- usable increments
- fixed length 1-4 weeks
- product backlog
- a potentialy shippable increment

Scrum Artifacts
- product backlog
  - list of everything currently part of the product vision
  - always changing
  - product owner is incharge of backlog
     - product manager
- sprint backlog
  - List of items to achive 
  - only the development team can add to it once it is set
  - development team need to negotiate the removal of items with the owner
- usable product increment
  - the actual product at the end of the sprint
  - "potentially releasable"
  - meet the team's "definition of done"
 
User story
- contained in product backlog
- features to be developed
- perspective of the user

Benefits
- keeps the focus on the user
- stories enable collaboration
- stories drive creative solution
- stories create momentum

User story format
- you start with
  - "As a"
  - "I want to" 
  - "So that I"

Consideration
- acceptance criteris
- defenition of done
- story pointing
- burndown charts

Acceptance criteria
- helps define when the functionality of the user story has been implemented
- criteria is what we percieve as acceptable
- given/when/then

Definition of Done
- it is defined by scrum team
- describe what need to be fulfilled for a story to be considered complete


- internall products(tools company is using)
- business to consumer (market research)
- business to business(user stories are based on what consumers want)

Story pointing
- estimating amount of effort needed to complete a particular user story
- rather than concrete estimate, we use story points

Story points could be
- fibonacci numbers
- T-shirt sizes
- etc.

Burndown chart
- used to track progress
- user stories are added to backlog
- number of points can be visualized
- should idealy be at 0 once sprint is done

Scrum Roles
- scrum master
  - facilitates scrum practices
  - clarifies questions
  - assists removal of blockers
  - facilitates scrum ceremonies
- Product Owner
- development team
  - software engineers + developers

Scrum team
- scrum roles are different people involved in the scrum team
-one scrum master
- one product manager
- many developers/testers
- 10 or fewer people
- no hierchy
-

Scrum ceremonies
- official meetings
- transparancy required for adapting and improving
- share understading and reduce ambuguity

Ceremonies
- sprint planing meeting
- Daily standup meeting
  - once a day
  - back log is inspected
  - 15 min
  - each team member answers 
    - what did you do yesterday
    - what will you do today
    - are there any blockers?
-sprint review meeting
  - happens at the end of a sprint
  - inspect outcome
  - determine future adaptions
  - present results to stakeholders
  - progree towards product goal is discussed
- sprint retrospective
  - after sprint review meeting
  - how to improve for next sprint
  - identify useful changes to improve
